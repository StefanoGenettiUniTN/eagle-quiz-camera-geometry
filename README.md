# Camera geometry
The purpose of this repository is to provide a tool to solve the most common geometric transformation which are investigated in the context of the popular pinhole camera model. In more depth, the proposed Python notebook (`camera-solver.ipynb`) allows to convert the coordinates of a point:
- from image reference system (2D) to camera reference system (3D)
- from camera reference system (3D) to image reference system (2D)
- from camera reference system (3D) to real world reference system (3D)
- from real world reference system (3D) to camera reference system (3D)

## Repository
- `camera-solver.ipynb` main Python notebook
- `fsg-camera-quiz.pdf` solution proposal for the FSG camera quiz
- `quiz.png` FSG camera quiz version 1
- `quiz1.png` FSG camera quiz version 2 (same as the previous one but with slightly different parameters)

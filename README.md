# Camera geometry
The purpose of this notebook is to provide a tool to solve the most common geometric transformation which are investigated in the context of the popular pinhole camera model. In more depth, the following code cells allows to convert the coordinates of a point:
- from image reference system (2D) to camera reference system (3D)
- from camera reference system (3D) to image reference system (2D)
- from camera reference system (3D) to real world reference system (3D)
- from real world reference system (3D) to camera reference system (3D)
